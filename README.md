# SHA-256-Verilog-HDL
SHA-2 (Secure Hash Algorithm 2), of which SHA-256 is a part, is one of the most popular hashing algorithms out there.
SHA-2 is known for its security (it hasnâ€™t broken down like SHA-1), and its speed. In cases where keys are not being generated, such as mining Bitcoin, 
a fast hash algorithm like SHA-2 often reigns supreme.
# Algorithm steps
1. Pre-Processing
2. Initialize Hash Values (h)
3. Initialize Round Constants (k)
4. Chunk Loop
5. Create Message Schedule (w)
6. Compression
7. Modify Final Values
8. Concatenate Final Hash
